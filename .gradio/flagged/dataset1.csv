Oval face, a canvas of light,
A secret unveiled in the evening's might.
Dark skin, a mantle that softly falls,
A story yet untold, like an ancient call.

(Chorus)
Surprise, a flicker of wonder's flame,
A revelation of beauty's range.
A tapestry of features, a sight to behold,
A symphony of grace, a story to be told.

(Verse 2)
Eyes wide, pupils reflecting the night,
A gaze that's both curious and filled with delight.
Hair flowing freely, a cascade unbound,
A halo of beauty, a story to be sung.

(Verse 3)
A smile that's both radiant and shy,
A laugh that's a melody, a symphony.
A spirit that's vibrant, a soul so true,
An oval face, a treasure for me.

(Chorus)
Surprise, a flicker of wonder's flame,
A revelation of beauty's range.
A tapestry of features, a sight to behold,
A symphony of grace, a story to be told.

(Outro)
In the depths of my being, a secret lies,
A beauty that shines, breaking through the skies.
An oval face, a wonder to behold,
A testament to diversity, a story to be told.",.gradio/flagged/output 1/7b4eb30d1e93516be9af/melody.wav,.gradio/flagged/output 2/5368ef3e5dfa7f96feea/output.wav,2025-02-17 14:09:05.728041
